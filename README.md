# AWSMachineLearning
Introduction to AWS Machine Learning Foundations

# Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
- Identify problems that can be solved with machine learning.
- Describe commonly used algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means.
- Describe how training and testing works.
- Evaluate the performance of a machine learning model using metrics.


# Advice From the Experts
Remember the following advice when training your model.

-  Practitioners often use machine learning frameworks that already have working implementations of models and model training algorithms. You could implement these from scratch, but you probably won't need to do so unless youâ€™re developing new models or algorithms.

- Practitioners use a process called model selection to determine which model or models to use. The list of established models is constantly growing, and even seasoned machine learning practitioners may try many different types of models while solving a problem with machine learning.

- Hyperparameters are settings on the model which are not changed during training but can affect how quickly or how reliably the model trains, such as the number of clusters the model should identify.

- Be prepared to iterate.
